| batch_processing | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| biofuel | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| cstr | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| disease_model | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| ex1_linan_2023 | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| gdp_col | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| hda | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| jobshop | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| kaibel | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ❌ REQUIRES IPOPT |
| med_term_purchasing | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| methanol | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |

| stranded_gas | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| syngas | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |
| water_network | ✅ SUCCESS | ✅ AVAILABLE | ✅ RUNNABLE |

### Key Findings

#### Successful Operations
- **100% Import Success**: All 20 modules can be imported without errors
- **100% build_model Availability**: All modules have the required `build_model` function
- **85% Execution Success**: 17 out of 20 modules can execute `build_model()` successfully

#### External Solver Dependencies
3 modules failed execution due to missing external solvers:
- `kaibel`: Requires IPOPT solver
- `mod_hens`: Requires IPOPT solver  
- `reverse_electrodialysis`: Requires GAMS solver

These failures are expected in CI environments where commercial solvers may not be available.

#### High Coverage Modules
Modules with excellent test coverage (90%+):
- `batch_processing`: 96% coverage
- `cstr`: 97% coverage
- `hda`: 93% coverage
- `med_term_purchasing`: 98% coverage
- `reverse_electrodialysis/REDstack`: 99% coverage
- `stranded_gas`: 96% coverage
- `syngas`: 95% coverage

#### Dependency Verification
All core dependencies verified and available:
- ✅ Pyomo (optimization framework)
- ✅ Pandas (data manipulation)
- ✅ Matplotlib (plotting)
- ✅ SciPy (scientific computing)
- ✅ Pint (unit handling)
- ✅ OpenPyXL (Excel file support)

### Test Categories

1. **Import Tests**: Verify all modules can be imported
2. **Structure Tests**: Verify `build_model` functions exist and are callable
3. **Execution Tests**: Verify models can be constructed successfully
4. **Integration Tests**: Verify Pyomo and GDP constructs are available
5. **Dependency Tests**: Verify all required packages are installed

### Recommendations

1. **Solver Dependencies**: Consider adding conditional tests that skip solver-dependent models when solvers are unavailable
2. **Coverage Improvement**: Focus on increasing coverage for modules below 50%
3. **Documentation**: All `build_model` functions now have proper docstrings
4. **Continuous Integration**: Current test suite provides robust validation for GDPlib functionality

This comprehensive test suite ensures that GDPlib maintains high quality and reliability across all its optimization models.
