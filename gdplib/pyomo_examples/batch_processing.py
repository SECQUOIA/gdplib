# Problem from http://www.minlp.org/library/problem/index.php?i=172&lib=GDP
# We are minimizing the cost of a design of a plant with parallel processing units and storage tanks
# in between. We decide the number and volume of units, and the volume and location of the storage
# tanks. The problem is convexified and has a nonlinear objective and global constraints

# NOTE: When I refer to 'gams' in the comments, that is Batch101006_BM.gms for now. It's confusing
# because the _opt file is different (It has hard-coded bigM parameters so that each constraint 
# has the "optimal" bigM).


def build_model():
    """
    Constructs and initializes a Pyomo model for the batch processing problem. 

    The model is designed to minimize the total cost associated with the design and operation of a plant consisting of multiple
    parallel processing units with intermediate storage tanks. 
    It involves determining the optimal number and sizes of processing units, batch sizes for different products at various stages, and sizes and
    placements of storage tanks to ensure operational efficiency while meeting production requirements within a specified time horizon.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    Pyomo.ConcreteModel
        An instance of the Pyomo ConcreteModel class representing the batch processing optimization model, 
        ready to be solved with an appropriate solver.
